Experiment 1: Study of CRO, Multimeter

1. Story Outline
This experiment is designed to help learners understand the working principles, components, and applications of basic electronic test and measurement instruments – the Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO) and the Digital Multimeter (DMM). These instruments are essential for testing and debugging electronic circuits.

Through this virtual simulation, the user will explore the structure, controls, and functionalities of a CRO and a multimeter. They will learn to use the CRO to observe waveforms, measure frequency, voltage, and time period. They will also use the multimeter to measure resistance, voltage (AC/DC), and continuity. The virtual setup provides realistic behavior and interactivity, ensuring a close-to-lab experience.

### 2. Story
The user enters a virtual electronics lab where they are introduced to a CRO and a multimeter placed on a digital workbench. Instructions guide the learner through various operations, such as adjusting time/div and volts/div knobs on the CRO, connecting probes to function generators, and interpreting the resulting waveforms. For the multimeter, the user selects the appropriate measurement mode, connects test leads, and records measurements.

The simulator provides interactive feedback and tooltips to help users understand errors and correct usage. The system validates results based on correct connections and control settings. At the end, users are evaluated on their ability to handle and interpret the readings from both instruments accurately


#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
The visual canvas includes:

1.A virtual lab bench displaying a CRO, multimeter, function generator, resistors, and a circuit board.

2.Test leads and probes that can be dragged and connected.

3.Knobs, switches, and buttons on CRO and multimeter that users can interact with.

4.Real-time display of signals on the CRO screen.

5.Digital display on the multimeter changing dynamically based on the circuit and mode selected.

6.Tabs or popups showing basic info/tooltips about components and controls.
#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
The key objectives for the user are:

1.To identify and understand the basic parts and working of CRO and multimeter.

2.To learn to measure voltage, time period, and frequency using CRO.

3.To measure resistance, AC/DC voltage, and test continuity using a multimeter.

4.To analyze signal waveforms and verify circuit behavior using instruments.

The user begins by exploring the CRO and multimeter interface, reads tooltips or hover guides, selects measurement tasks from a list, and performs measurements by interacting with controls and probes.

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

Step 1: Introduction screen explaining CRO and multimeter.

Step 2: Select a task (e.g., “Measure frequency using CRO” or “Measure resistance using multimeter”).

Step 3: For CRO:

i.Connect function generator to CRO.

ii.Adjust time/div and volts/div knobs.

iii.Trigger and stabilize the waveform.

iv.Measure parameters and note down values.

Step 4: For Multimeter:

i.Set the correct mode (resistance, voltage, continuity).

ii.Connect probes to circuit components.

iii.Read the digital display.

Step 5: Submit measurement results.

Step 6: Receive feedback and evaluation.

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

1.Select correct mode on multimeter for specific measurement (e.g., user mistakenly selects AC mode instead of DC).

2.Connect probes in the correct orientation.

3.Analyze waveform distortion due to incorrect CRO settings.

4.Observe signal frequency from waveform manually.

5.Determine error in reading if probe position or range is incorrect.


##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
1.Users may incorrectly set volts/div or time/div causing the waveform to be unreadable.

2.Incorrect probe connections may result in wrong or no reading.

3.Choosing incorrect multimeter function may lead to damage in real scenarios – simulated here by a warning.

4.Forgetting to set the ground reference or trigger level on CRO.

These are handled via hints, feedback, or visual alerts in the simulator.

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
At the end of the simulation, the system displays:

1.Tasks completed

2.Correct vs. incorrect readings

3.Hints used

4.Time taken per task

The learner receives qualitative feedback (e.g., “Good control of CRO”, “Check polarity in multimeter connection”) and a score to reflect performance. They leave the experiment with a better conceptual and practical grasp of using test instruments.



##### 2.7 Equations/formulas: NA

No specific equations are used in this experiment. Reference values and waveform parameters will be provided during the simulation and measured using the instruments.
