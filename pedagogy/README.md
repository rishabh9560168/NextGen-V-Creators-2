#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  : Guided Simulation    
###### Assessment Method: Observation-based tasks, MCQs, Measurement Analysis  

<u> <b>Description: </b>    </u>
<br>
The simulator will provide virtual CRO and multimeter interfaces. Students will select probes, apply signals to test points, and take measurements. Virtual controls such as time/div, volts/div, and selector switches will simulate a real lab. Students will be asked to compare values and waveform characteristics with expected theoretical results.

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Identify instrument features | Explore interface and label parts | What are the functions of the CRO knobs?
2.| Measure voltage and frequency | Use CRO probes on signal source and adjust scale | What frequency and amplitude does the waveform show?
3.| Measure resistance and continuity | Use multimeter on various components | How would you check for continuity in a wire?
