## 1. Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO)

### Working Principle:
A CRO works by directing an electron beam across a phosphorescent screen. By applying voltages to horizontal and vertical deflection plates, the position of the beam is manipulated to visualize waveforms.

### Key Components:
- **CRT (Cathode Ray Tube)**
- **Vertical & Horizontal Amplifiers**
- **Time Base Generator**
- **Deflection Plates**
- **Triggering System**

### Applications:
- Observing waveforms (sine, square, triangular)
- Measuring voltage, frequency, and phase difference
- Troubleshooting circuits

### Key Controls:
- **Time/Div**: Adjusts time scale of signal
- **Volt/Div**: Adjusts voltage scale
- **Trigger**: Stabilizes waveform
- **Probe Input**: Connects to the test point

## 2. Digital Multimeter

### Working Principle:
A Digital Multimeter measures electrical parameters by converting analog signals into digital form using an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter).

### Functions:
- **Voltage Measurement (AC/DC)**
- **Current Measurement (AC/DC)**
- **Resistance Measurement**
- **Continuity Testing**
- **Diode Testing**

### Modes of Operation:
- Select appropriate measurement mode using the rotary switch
- Connect probes to the correct ports (COM, VÎ©, A)
- Observe the result on the digital display
