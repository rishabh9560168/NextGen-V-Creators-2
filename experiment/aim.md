# Aim

The primary aim of this experiment is to enable students to understand the fundamental concepts, structure, and operation of two essential electronic instruments: the Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO) and the Digital/Analog Multimeter.

The specific objectives of this experiment are:

- To study the working principle and internal structure of a CRO.
- To understand how a CRO displays waveforms and measures signal properties such as amplitude, frequency, and time period.
- To demonstrate the proper usage of a multimeter for measuring voltage, current, and resistance.
- To differentiate between analog and digital multimeters and understand their respective advantages and limitations.
- To familiarize learners with practical applications and real-time signal analysis using these instruments.
- To prepare students for real-world lab environments by simulating accurate readings and responses.

By the end of this experiment, learners should be able to confidently operate both the CRO and multimeter and interpret their measurements in various circuit scenarios.
