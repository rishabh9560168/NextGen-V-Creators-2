### Procedure
# ðŸ§ª Study of CRO and Multimeter â€“ Procedure

This document outlines the step-by-step procedure to interactively simulate and understand the working of the Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO) and Multimeter in the virtual lab.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To explore and learn the basic operation of the CRO and Multimeter through simulation, and understand how to measure voltage, current, resistance, frequency, and waveform properties.

---

## ðŸ§° Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of electronic components (resistors, power supply, signal sources)
- Understanding of AC and DC signals
- Familiarity with voltage, current, resistance units and measurements

---

## ðŸ”¬ Simulation Procedure

### Part A: Using the **CRO**

---

### Step 1: **Launch Simulation**
Open the simulation page via the virtual lab interface or GitHub deployment link.

---

### Step 2: **Power ON the CRO**
Use the virtual **Power** switch to turn on the CRO.

---

### Step 3: **Select Input Signal**
Choose from available signal sources:
- Sine Wave
- Square Wave
- Triangular Wave
- Custom Waveform (if supported)

You may also select the **frequency** and **amplitude** of the signal.

---

### Step 4: **Connect Signal to Channel**
Click and drag virtual wires to connect the selected signal source to **Channel 1 (CH1)** of the CRO.

---

### Step 5: **Adjust Display Settings**
Tune the following knobs/sliders:
- **Time/Div**: Controls horizontal scaling (time axis)
- **Volt/Div**: Controls vertical scaling (voltage axis)
- **Position**: Adjust vertical or horizontal position of the waveform
- **Focus and Intensity**: Improve display clarity (optional)

---

### Step 6: **Observe Waveform**
View the waveform displayed on the CRO screen. Analyze its:
- Amplitude (Voltage Peak-to-Peak)
- Frequency and Time Period
- Waveform Shape

You may pause the waveform for analysis or switch to a grid view to count divisions for measurements.

---

### Part B: Using the **Multimeter**

---

### Step 1: **Select Multimeter Mode**
Switch the multimeter to one of the following modes:
- **Voltage (DC/AC)**
- **Current (DC/AC)**
- **Resistance (Î©)**

---

### Step 2: **Choose Measurement Circuit**
Select a predefined circuit or create a custom one (resistor networks, voltage sources, etc.).

---

### Step 3: **Connect Probes**
Drag and drop virtual probes (Red â€“ positive, Black â€“ ground) to the appropriate points in the circuit.

---

### Step 4: **Read Measurement**
Observe the digital display showing the measured value based on the selected mode.

---

### Step 5: **Try Various Readings**
Repeat the process to:
- Measure resistance across components
- Check continuity
- Measure current in series circuits
- Verify voltage across series/parallel components

---

### Step 6: **Reset and Experiment Again**
Use the **Reset** or **Clear Circuit** button to start a new measurement session or change component configurations.

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Outcomes

- Understand signal behavior via CRO
- Interpret frequency, time period, and amplitude from waveform
- Accurately measure electrical quantities using a multimeter
- Gain confidence in virtual instrument handling for real lab preparation
